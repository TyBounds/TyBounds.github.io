<p> This is a clone of the clasic game tetris. It uses the same concept the original with a 2d rayfor the game board. The shapes are also made in 2d ray's.
But once you click run it spawns in a shape and you use the asd shapes to control their movements.</p>

<p>The first imgage shows the spawning system working and how the shapes are made by a ray</p>

<p>This is showing how there is an error in the deletion system when the shape moves to a new point in the game</p>

<p>This is is the making of the shapes in the 2d ray</p>
<p>This has showed me how much it really  takes to make even the most basic game and how much time and work go into it</p>
